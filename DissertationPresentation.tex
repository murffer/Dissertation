\section{Conclusions}
\subsection*{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Neutron - Gamma Discrimination}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Devloped a method for pulse height discrimination to achieve a gamma intrsinic efficiency of less than \num{1E-6}
    \item Completed detailed energy simulations (and preformed validaiton)
    \item Attributed the pulse height discrimination ability to the ranges of the secondary electrons
    \item Suggested film thickness is between \SI{50}{\um} and \SI{150}{\um}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Designed Layered RPM Detector}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simulated layered detector designs with XSDRN, MCNPX, GEANT4
    \item Optimized a layered detector design capable of meeting the criteria
    \item Cylindrical designs show promise as well
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Light Collection in an RPM}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Completed light transport simulations of single films, 4" by 6" detector assembly, and a full scale RPM
    \item Parameter studies indicate that teflon tape is better than mylar
    \item Wavelength shifters greatly improve the light collection efficiencies
    \item Typical events in an scintillator RPM will collect between 5\% and 10\% of the emitted light
  \end{itemize}
