The detector's performance should change by no more than 10\% in a strong gamma field
\begin{itemize}
	\item GARRn is measured by exposing the detector to a 10 mR/hr gamma field while exposed to neutron source
	\item Count rate is measured when the gamma source is no longer present
	\item Difference determines the GARRn
