What GEANT4 is:
\begin{itemize}
  \small
  \item \href{geant4.cern.ch}{geant4.cern.ch}
  \item Free software package for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter
  \item Essentially a collection of tools for geometry, materials, physics models, events and digitization, visualizations $\dots$
  \item Maintained by the CERN community, widely used in physics
\end{itemize}
What GEANT4 is not:
\begin{itemize}
  \small
  \item For the timid
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Users are responsible for correctly implementing their own physics
    \item Users are responsible for correctly implementing their own analysis
  \end{itemize}
  \item Stagnant - major release are still occurring
\end{itemize}
