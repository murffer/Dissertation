Scintillation detectors (the detectors on which this work is based) utilize a scintillator to convert ionizing radiation into photons.
In inorganic scintillators these photons arise from excitations of electrons in the band gap of the material or dopant, while for organic scintillators the photons generally come from relaxations of aromatic rings in the molecule.
Typically the light emitted from the primary phosphor is of a wavelength that is not suitable for detection with a photomultiplier tube, so a secondary fluor is added to absorb and reemit the light at a more favorable wavelength for detection.
The process of scintillation in organic scintillators is explained in more detail in \autoref{sec:OrganicScinillators}, while the number of photons emitted for different types of ionizing radiation is discussed in \autoref{sec:PulseHeightDeficit}.

\subsection{Organic Scintillators}
\label{sec:OrganicScinillators}
An organic scintillator generally has a $\pi$-electron structure similar to that of \autoref{fig:benzePiStructure} with typical energy levels as shown in \autoref{fig:pielectron}.
An incoming electron (liberated from the energy deposition of the ionizing radiation) then excites one of the modes of the $\pi$-electron structure.
Higher singlet states rapidly (on the order of picoseconds) relax to the first singlet state, and excessive vibrational energy (populations of the vibrational sates) is lost.
Thus, after a short period of time the entire excitation population is in the $S_{10}$ state, and the decay of this state creates the prompt fluorescence.

Figure from Wikipedia.}
  \label{fig:pielectron}
\end{figure}
The excitations of triplet states typically yield delayed scintillation events or phosphorescence.
An excited triplet states immediately decays to the $T_0$ state by internal degradation without a photon emission.
The $T_0$ state typically decays by interacting with another $T_0$ state in a $T_0 + T_0 \to S^* + S_0 + h\nu$ transition.
The excited singlet state $S^*$ then also decays to the $S_0$ state.
The $T_0 + T_0$ transitions is slower than direct singlet state de-excitations, and results in a slow component of the pulse, which can be used for pulse shape discrimination.

The light output of an organic scintillator can be empirically related to the energy deposition in the scintillator through the Birks equation \cite{birks_scintillations_1951}.
In the absence of any quenching it is assumed that the light output per unit length is directly proportional to the energy deposition per unit length \eqref{eqn:LONoQuench}
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:LONoQuench}
    \frac{dL}{dx} = S_B\frac{dE}{dx}
\end{align}
where \definevar{$S_B$}{absolute scintillation efficiency} and \definevar{$\frac{dE}{dx}$}{linear stopping power} .
If quenching of the light from molecules damaged by the radiation is also assumed to be proportional to the energy deposition per track length, than the Birks equation can be written as \eqref{eqn:BirksEquation}
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:BirksEquation}
    \frac{dL}{dx} = \frac{S_B\frac{dE}{dx}}{1+kB\frac{dE}{dx}}
    \end{align}
    where \definevar{$kB$}{Birks parameter} which accounts for the quenching of the light.
For low stopping powers (or particles with a very high energy) the light output per unit track length is linear as the quenching term can be neglected.
However, for particles with a large stopping power the light output along the track length becomes saturated by quenching.
This difference in the pulse height accounts for that difference in light output from a \SI{1}{\MeV} electron compared to a \SI{1}{\MeV} alpha.
The \textit{alpha to beta} ratio provides a measure of this effect, and for the GS20 glass is it typically around 0.23.
This effect is critical in the developed detectors are the reaction products of of the \iso[6]{Li} neutron absorption are both heavily charged particles subject to this effect.
Thus, while there is \SI{4.78}{\MeV} of reaction product energy released in the neutron absorption, the low alpha to beta ratio of the material limits the actual number of scintillation events compared to those produced by a \SI{4.78}{\MeV} beta (electron).

\subsection{Pulse Height Deficit}
\label{sec:PulseHeightDeficit}
The concept of alpha to beta ratio is extended for other charged ions as the pulse height deficit.
The pulse height deficit is defined as the number of photons produced per energy of the primary particle (usually a heavy charged ion) relative to the number of photons produced per energy by an electron of a similar energy.
This is measured as the difference between the energy of the heavy ion and its apparent energy from the pulse height.  
Several researchers have investigated the light output of scintillators in response to different types of ionizing radiation\cite{Verbinski_1968}.
\autoref{fig:lightYieldVerbinski} summarizes example results in which the pulse height deficit is apparent for the as the charged ions become heavier.
\begin{figure}

For the same kinetic energy the protons produce more photons alpha, which in turn produces more photons than the  carbon ions. This is an example of the pulse height deficit. Data from \cite{Verbinski_1968}.}
  \label{fig:lightYieldVerbinski}
\end{figure}

An illustration of the energy deposition between the different particles resulting in the pulse height deficit is presented in \autoref{fig:ParticleTracks}.
The electrons, with their low stopping power and broad track structure deposit their energy over a broader range than do the heavy charged ions (which tend to have rather collimated tracks).
Thus, the heavy charged ions deposit a large amount of their energy in a small volume, completely ionizing that volume and inhibiting scintillation.

The electron tracks are broader than the heavy ion tracks, resulting in a greater spread of the energy deposition and less quenching.}
  \label{fig:ParticleTracks}
\end{figure}

For a portal monitor scintillator the most likely charged particles would be alphas, tritons and electrons.
GEANT4 has the capability to simulate light quenching by setting an appropriate Birks parameter, and \autoref{fig:SimLightOutputQuench} presents GEANT4 simulated photon distributions in polystyrene with a PPO-POPOP fluor and an assumed light yield of 1,000 photons per MeV.
For highly energetic particles the electrons are almost an order of magnitude more efficient at creating light than the tritons, and about 90 times more efficient than the alphas, as shown in \autoref{fig:SimNumOP}.
However, it is unlikely that many electrons originating from \iso[60]{Co} interactions in the scintillator will have an energy in the \SI{1}{\MeV} range, more likely that they will be in the \SI{100}{\keV} range.
Thus, as shown in \autoref{fig:SimLightOutputQuench} the triton from the \iso[6]{Li} reaction will produce about an factor of five more photons than at \SI{100}{\keV}, and dominates the number of photons produced by the alpha particle.

The pulse height deficit is computed by simulation of the charged particles and the corresponding electron.
This analysis yields a  pulse height deficit for the \iso[6]{Li} reaction as 8.5, and 27 for the \iso[10]{B}.
These results are summarized in \autoref{tab:PulseHeightDeficitSim}.
