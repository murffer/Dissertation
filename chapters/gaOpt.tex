\section{Introduction}
Effective utilization of the neutron flux and is necessary for minimizing the amount of neutron absorber (\iso[6]{Li}) that is used in the detector.

Several possible geometries have been considered for the films. 
They are generally a vertical or horizontal layer of the films or a vertical or horizontal aragment of the films aranged in cocentric cylindars.
\section{Methods}

\subsection{Genetic Algorthim Introduction}
The genetic algorithm typically consist of four tasks: creating an initial population, evaluating that populations fitness, selecting members of the current population to breed, and then applying genetic operators to the selected members to breed the new population. 
This is completed for either a maximum generation is reached or the desired fitness is achieved. 
[Start] Generate random population of n chromosomes (suitable solutions for the problem)
[Fitness] Evaluate the fitness f(x) of each chromosome x in the population
[New population] Create a new population by repeating following steps until the new population is complete
[Selection] Select two parent chromosomes from a population according to their fitness (the better fitness, the bigger chance to be selected)
[Crossover] With a crossover probability cross over the parents to form a new offspring (children). If no crossover was performed, offspring is an exact copy of parents.
[Mutation] With a mutation probability mutate new offspring at each locus (position in chromosome).
[Accepting] Place new offspring in a new population
[Replace] Use new generated population for a further run of algorithm
[Test] If the end condition is satisfied, stop, and return the best solution in current population
[Loop] Go to step 2

First, however, it is necessary to become familar with the terms used in genetic programming.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+genome+ The set of all genes of an individual, where a gene is a problem parameter.  The problem representation
  \item \verb+population+ All individuals that represent a solution to the problem at a given point in time
  \item \verb+selection+ Choosing which individuals go on to produce new offspring
\end{itemzie}
\subsubsection{Initial Population}

The inital population


\subsection{Population Selection}

Population selection was achieved using a hybrid approach of tournament
selection and rank selection. In rank selection the individuals were
selected based on their rank, where the rank was determined by their
fitness (lower SSE correspond to a higher fitness). Tournament selection
was used to generate the other component of the population for breeding.
\subsection{Genetic Operators}

Individuals selected for reproduction are subjected to genetic operators
to breed the next generation. Genetic programs generally contain two
genetic operators, crossover and mutation. Crossover serves to create
new members of the population by interchanging the genetic material
(tree structure) of two parents in which significant changes in the
tree solutions are achieved. Mutation serves to slightly modify an
existing solution. 


\subsubsection{Crossover}

Crossover is defined in genetic programming as the swapping of sub-trees
between individuals in the population, which is meant to mimic the
crossover of genes that occurs during evolution. As the solutions
are recursively defined, crossover was implemented by selecting randomly
selecting a two nodes from different trees and swapping their parents.


\subsubsection{Mutation}

Mutation, unlike crossover, does not involve changes to the structure
of the solution but rather operators within the solution. For example,
in symbolic regression mutation will randomly (defined by the mutation
rate) change the node function and leaf values, but it will not add
or prune branches to the tree structure. Mutation was implemented
as a recursive traversal of the tree, switching the function types
with other functions types according to a user supplied probability.
The terminals mutations were implemented in a similar fashion, but
if the node was a value leaf the leaf was randomly set to a new random
variable. An example of mutation is shown in Figure \ref{Mutation}.

\subsubsection{Selection Techniques}
Several differnet selection technqiues are available to select the individuals from one population to reproduce in the next.
Among the most common are fitness proportional selection (roulette selection) and tournament selection.

Fitness proporitional selection (or roulette selection) occurs when the individuals are ranked by their fitness, and individuals are chosen by their fitness rank.
Imagine a roulette wheel where the space a canidate occupies on the wheel is proporitonal to its fiteness.  
Higher fitness individuals will occupy more space, and will thus have a higher probability of being selected.

Roulette selection avoids some of the local minima by providing an opertunity for less fit individuals to be selected.

However, not all of these interactions will lead to counts above the pulse height discriminator setting necessary for meeting the gamma intrinsic efficiency.
This is corrected for by scaling $I_{\text{sim}}$ by the fraction of counts, $\eta$, that occur above the gamma LLD \eqref{eqn:FractionOfCountsDefination}, \eqref{eqn:RPMCountRate}.
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:FractionOfCountsDefination}
  \eta \equiv \frac{\int_{MLLD}^\infty p(x)dx}{\int_0^\infty p(x)dx}
\end{align}
\nomenclature{$p(x)$}{Measured spectra, as a function of channel number}
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:RPMCountRate}
 \text{Count Rate} &= I_{\text{sim}} \eta
\end{align}

Further refinement of the spacing could be completed in the MCNPX calculations by adjust the slices a millimeter to the left or right for each one.

\section{Conclusions}

A physical basis of the optimal solution found by the genetic algorthim can be found by observing the form of the optimal solutions.
These solutions involve an intial moderator layer in order to ensure that all of the neutrons are thermalized to (increasing the thermal fraction by \textbf{SOME PRECENT}).
After this moderator layer a film layer is placed to utilize this neutron spectra; however not all of the thermal neutrons are captured (as the mean free path of a neutron in polyethylene is about \si{0.37}{\cm} and thus some pass through the material) and another abosrber layer is needed to capture those neutrons.  
The neutron flux is then moderated again, and additional layers of detectors are needed to capture this neutron cross section.
However, it is desirably to have a large neutron reflector in the portal monitor to reflect neturons back into the detector slices. 
Theortically this reflector should be as large as possible, but the limited space of the RPM provides a constraint.
A parameter study with a single detector slice between a moderator and reflector constrained by the radiaiton portal monitor design showed that it is desriable to have around \textbf{So much} moderator leaving the majority of the RPM to be left for the reflector.
Thus it is demonstrated that a large reflector is desired.
