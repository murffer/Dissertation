Detecting radiation utilizing a scintillation detector involves several physical processes, which can be elucidated by imagining a typical interaction in the RPM.
A neutron incident upon the radiation portal monitor interacts by mostly elastic scattering with the nuclei in the RPM material, eventually slowing down to thermal ranges.
Once thermal, the neutron then has a large probability of interaction with a neutron absorber in the RPM, which releases fission products into the material.
These fission products then interact with the material by slowing down and depositing energy.
The material needs to convert the deposited energy into light through scintillation, and then the photons produced by scintillation need to be collected and transformed into a signal.

Effective design of a radiation portal monitor should then be guided by the physics guiding the processes of interest.
The process of the thermalization of the neutrons and nuclear absorptions are discussed in \autoref{sec:NuclearInteractions}.
Next, the charged particle interactions and ranges are discussed in \autoref{sec:InteractionsAndRange}.
The scintillation processes is discussed in \autoref{sec:ScintMechancis}, and is followed by a brief discussion of optics in \autoref{sec:OpticsTheory}.
