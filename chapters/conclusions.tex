Thin polymeric films loaded with \iso[6]{Li} films or \iso[6]{Li} loaded ZnS:Ag scintillators show promise for replacement portal monitors. 
Design of a replacement detector technology capable of meeting the criteria  set forth by DHS/DNOD needs to consider the neutron interaction used for detection, the subsequent energy deposition  of the reaction products into the material, the scintillation that results from the energy deposition, and the transport of photons from the interaction site to the photomultiplier tube.
Understanding these complex reactions involve understanding the mechanisms of scintillation, light transport, and energy deposition.
Techniques need to be developed for determining the gamma intrinsic efficiency and simulated detector performance while validating the simulations with measurements.

\section{Neutron - Gamma Discrimination}
The neutron - gamma discrimination necessary for RPMs may be satisfied for thin films by employing a pulse height discriminator.
A mathematical lower level discriminator (MLLD) is established for a given film by computing for which channel the integrated photon spectra (above the given channel) normalized by the photon fluence (determined by MCNPX simulations) is less than \num{1E-6}.
Counts above the MLLD are classified as neutron counts, and counts below are discarded.
The thickness of the film impacts the discrimination firstly through the interaction rate, but a far greater contribution to the neutron - gamma discrimination originates from the range of the secondary electrons produced by Compton scattering in gamma-photon events and their energy deposition.
The electrons from the gamma interactions generally have energies on the order of 100 keV, while energies from the charged particle reactions of the neutrons have energies or the order to 10 keV.
Thus, the neutron reaction product energies tend to deposit more energy in the film than their gamma produced counterparts.
It is the poor energy deposition by electrons generated from photon events that allow for films to be much thicker than the thickness predicted based on the interaction rate.
A \SI{150}{\um} thick film absorbs over 90\% of the energy deposition of the neutron reaction products, thus there is little reason to fabricate films thicker than \SI{150}{\um} because it allows for a greater percentage of energy to be deposited from gammas, resulting in a higher MLLD setting and a lower amount of neutron counts that can be considered.

\section{Film Placement}
A single film does not have an adequate neutron count rate to satisfy the neutron detector requirements of 2.5 cps per nanogram \iso[252]{Cf} in a source that is \SI{2}{\m} from the detector midpoint, shielded by \SI{0.5}{\cm} of lead and moderated by \SI{2.5}{\cm} of high density polyethylene.
Layering the detectors, however, has been shown to improve the neutron count rate while maintaing the necessary gamma intrinsic detection efficiency.
A simple repeated layer design was first proposed, but due to the changing neutron flux through the detector, it was quickly discarded as a poor utilization of the \iso[6]{Li}.
Genetic algorithms were employed to optimize a binary model of the detector for the optimal geometry that had the highest count rate while using the least amount of absorber and still meeting the detection efficiency criteria.
This model consisted of using a binary representation of the layered detector geometry (where each layer is either a detector slice or moderator slice).
The model was then evaluated using MCNPX and XSDRN to simulate the expected neutron interaction rate performance.

The position of the slices necessary for having the best usage of the absorber material while still maintaining the neutron count rate necessary for the criteria are then determined by the genetic algorithm.
These layered detector designs consist of \SI{100}{\um}, \iso[6]{Li} fluoride loaded polymers that are encased in four millimeters of a wavelength shifter.
Three such layers (30 percent loaded with enriched LiF) can achieve an interaction rate of 3.82 interactions per second per nanogram of Cf-252 (using 12.6 grams of \iso[6]{Li}), while five layers can achieve an interaction rate of 5.31 interactions per second per nanogram of Cf-252 (using 21.0 grams of \iso[6]{Li})  and ten layers can achieve an interaction rate of 7.56 interactions per second per nanogram of Cf-252 (using 41.2 grams of \iso[6]{Li}).
Annotated MCNPX renderings of these geometries are shown in \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering25}, \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering5}, and \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering75}.

A physical basis of the optimal solution found by the genetic algorithm can be found by observing the form of the optimal solutions.
These solutions involve an initial moderator layer in order to ensure neutron thermalization.
After this moderator layer a film layer is placed to capture the thermal neutron spectra; however, not all of the thermal neutrons are captured (as the mean free path of a neutron in polyethylene is about \SI{0.37}{\cm} and thus some pass through the material).
A second absorber layer is needed to capture those neutrons.  
The neutron flux is then moderated again, and additional layers of detectors are needed to capture this neutron cross section.
However, it is desirable to have a large neutron reflector in the portal monitor to reflect neutrons back into the detector slices. 
Theoretically, this reflector should be as thick as possible, but the limited space of the RPM provides a constraint.

A wrapped detector design in which the detector layers are wrapped around a cylinder in concentric circles was also simulated for a variety of absorber loadings in polystyrene and polyethylene naphthalene.
It is observed that the neuronic performance does not depend greatly on the polymer in which the absorber in placed, although the PEN films contain a slightly lower mass fraction of \iso[6]{Li} for the same mass fraction of \iso[6]{LiF} as polystyrene due to PEN having a higher atomic weight than polystyrene.
Four cylinders (each \SI{2}{\cm} in outer diameter) placed equidistant in the RPM8 loaded with 30\% \iso[6]{LiF} would have an interaction rate above 3.2 interactions per second per nanogram \iso[252]{Cf}, thus meeting the neutron count rate criteria. These assemblies use \SI{28}{\gram} of \iso[6]{Li}, compared to the \SI{12.6}{\gram} of \iso[6]{Li} used in a layered design of a similar count rate.
This is a poor utilization of the absorber mass, but, it is attractive due to the ease of collecting the photons with a single PMT on the top and bottom of each cylinder.
The \iso[6]{Li} utilization of the four cylinder design can be improved by adding a fifth cylindrical detector assembly and increasing the spacing between the detector, which is leading to an approximation of planar sheet geometry.


\section{Light Collection}
Light transport modeling provides a method to calculate the performance of a detector design while providing improvement insights.
GEANT4 was used to simulate the neutron interactions, energy deposition, scintillation (with quenching) and the light transport to a PMT for a radiation portal monitor design (shown in \autoref{fig:G4RPM8Geo}).
This design has the \SI{100}{\um}, 10\% loaded \iso[6]{LiF} films sandwiched between wavelength shifting (each \SI{5}{\mm} thick) with a single PMT at the top and bottom.
This design collects 8\% of the optical photons emitted; for a polystyrene film with an average light yield of 2,000 photons per neutron 160 would then hit the photocathode.
If a \SI{5}{\in} PMT is used instead of a\SI{2}{\in} PMT it is estimated that the light output increases by a factor of \num{2.7} \cite{pnnl_14283}.

\section{Design Improvements}
It is known that the scintillation events that occur near the center of the detector have a low probability of their photons reaching the PMT.
Thus, the light collection efficiency could be improved by eliminating that material or by dedicating another PMT to cover the detector mid region.
Different light collection strategies could also be employed in which more PMT's (or larger PMTs) are added at different locations to improve the light collection, or using different wavelength shifters, coupling materials, and light guides.
Another improvement in the light collection could be to fabricate films that have less internal optical photon absorption.
In addition, the large mass of \iso[6]{Li} required could be reduced by examining methods in which an alternative to pulse height discrimination is employed, thus allowing for more of the neutron spectra to be utilized.
There still exists the need to couple the optimization of the light transport with the material usage.
For instance, it might be beneficial to have smaller subunits of (each optically independent) detector materials rather than monolithic slabs.
Another design might exploit the trade-off in the neutron fraction above the discrimination criteria by employing different film thickness in different locations within the radiation portal monitor.
