A toolkit for the optimization of a radiaiton portal monitor has been presented in which simulations and measurmeents are combined to form a design suite.

\section{Neturon - Photon Discrimination}
Attention needs to be paid to the thickness of a film in order to maximize the neutron / photon discrimination that goes simply beyond the probability of interaction.
Effective design must account for the energy deposition in the material, including the pulse height deficit of the impingement particle.
For example, the range of the alpha created in a \iso[6]{Li} neutron absorption is six times less than that of the triton, but the triton creates almost six times more photons than the alpha.
The choice of detector thickness must take this into account, and a balance struck.
