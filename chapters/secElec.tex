\chapter{Neutron - Gamma Discrimination}
\label{chap:SecElectron}

Effective neutron-gamma discrimination is integral to the performance of the detector.
Generally, two methods are available for discrimination; 1) pulse shape discrimination and 2) pulse height discrimination.
In pulse shape discrimination the different decay times between the neutron and gamma pulses are exploited to develop a metric that allows for the classification of the pulse.
Generally, pulse shape discrimination works best when the pulses are noticeably different.
Pulse height discrimination is based on setting a pulse height discriminator that acts as a partition between two classes of pulses.
This is generally easier to implement than pulse shape discrimination.
While some of the fabricated films show a small basis for pulse shape discrimination, this work will only focus on pulse height discrimination.

The pulse height discriminator setting necessary to achieve the neutron-gamma discrimination is achieved through the use of a mathematical lower level discriminator (MLLD).
This virtual discriminator establishes the bound where $\epsilon_{int,\gamma n}\leq 10^{-6}$, and counts above the MLLD are classified as neutron counts. 

It is currently understood that the light output per path length of the film (which is directly proportional to the pulses collected on the PMT) is related to the stopping power of the radiation in the film material.
For a given material the stopping power of the film will be constant, and therefore the light output of the film can be found by integrating the light output per path length over the total length of the film.
It is then possible to conclude that the light output of a film is proportional to the energy deposited in the film.

Preferential energy deposition by neutrons relative to gammas will enhance the discrimination by creating larger neutron light pulses than the gamma pulses, allowing for fewer neutron pulses to be classified as gamma pulses because they are below the MLLD.
Thus, neutron-gamma discrimination can be enhanced by optimizing the energy deposition in the film. 

The organization of this chapter is as follows.
An overview of scintillation mechanics of organic scintillators will be provided in \autoref{sec:ScintMechanics} in order to understand the relationship between scintillation and the energy deposited by charged particles.
The energy spectra and ranges of neutron and gamma reaction products will be discussed in \autoref{sec:InteractionsAndRange} (focusing on polystyrene) to explain the basis for the difference in energy depositions. 
Calculations of the energy deposition will be shown in \autoref{sec:EnergyDep} for polymeric materials, providing the foundation of neutron-gamma pulse height discrimination.

\section{Energy Deposition Simulations}
\label{sec:EnergyDeposition}
The GEANT4 toolkit has the ability to track the energy deposition in different materials as well as the tracking of electrons to a least \SI{1}{\keV}\cite{agostinelli_geant4simulation_2003}.
It is proposed to represent the detector geometry as a single layer of neutron absorbing thin polymeric film mounted on top of a non-scintillating material (PMMA).
For simplicity, the initial events for runs will be chosen by setting up a particle gun for thermal (\SI{0.025}{\eV}) neutrons upon the detector and for both gammas resulting from a \iso[60]{Co} decay.
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{GEANT4AnnotatedGeo_EnergyDepEvent}

	\label{fig:EDepSimGeo}
\end{figure}
It is expected that the the Livermore data-driven parameterized electromagnetic physics will be necessary to calculate the ionizing energy deposition, extending the standard electro-magnetic physics down to \SI{1}{\kilo\eV}.
The neutron interactions will be simulated with a hadronic modules, using the \verb+HP+ flavored modules to use the ENDF cross sections to calculate the interaction rates.

\subsection{Simulation Validation}
The validation of this GEANT4 simulation was completed by reproducing the single collision energy loss in water as well as comparing  the spectral shapes and averages of simulated and measured spectra.
The reproduction of the single collision energy loss will ensure that the electron physics are implemented correctly, while the simulation of the polymeric film energy deposition allows the user to gain confidence that the correct tracking and binning analysis has been implemented.

\subsubsection{Single Collision Energy Loss}
The simulation was validated by reproducing the single collision energy loss for water as well as comparing spectra shapes and averages of simulated spectra to the measured spectra.
The single collision energy loss spectra for water that was simulated is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SingleCollisionELossWater}.
In general there was excellent agreement between the simulated energy spectra and a previously published spectra\cite{turner_comparative_1982}, with the simulated spectra having much better resolution than the reference did not.
It is thought that this is due to the water model in GEANT4 having better cross sections than the previously published spectra.

  \caption{Single Collision Energy Loss of Water. The simulated energy spectra matches that of Turner\cite{turner_comparative_1982}.}
	\label{fig:SingleCollisionELossWater}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Spectra Agreement}
The validity of the GEANT4 simulation is determined by comparing the spectra shapes of measured spectra to simulated energy deposition.
Figure \ref{fig:spectraComparisonGamma} shows the comparison between the simulated energy deposition per incident photon from a \iso[60]{Co} source and the measured pulse height spectra from the \iso[60]{Co} irridiator per incident photon.
The energy calibration on the upper axis of the measured spectra was completed by finding the channel number at a given intrinsic efficiency and the corresponding energy at that intrinsic efficiency.
The energy of this feature on the measured spectra was then compared to the energy on the simulated spectra, with all of the values being within 10\%.

The average energy deposition and average pulse height are shown in Figure \ref{fig:EDepLightYield}. 
With the average energy deposition on the left axis and the average light yield (pulse height) on the right axis, it is possible to compare the measurement and the simulation and agreement is observed.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:Results}

The average energy deposited by a neutron and gamma reaction was investigated for different film thickness to determine if an optimal thickness does exits in a geometry similar to \autoref{fig:EDepSimGeo}.
\autoref{fig:SimEDep} shows that the energy deposition of the gamma quickly falls off as the films get thinner, while it isn't util the neutron films become on the order of the range of the triton that the energy deposition is impacted.
\autoref{fig:EDepPosSim} examines the impact of where the interaction took place in the film on the energy deposition.
The geometry for this simulation is once again \autoref{fig:EDepSimGeo}, where the beam spot is \SI{3}{\mm} and the area of the detector face is \SI{10}{\cm}. 
The interaction position is then defined to be distance to the first interaction of the beam in the material along the direction of the beam.
It is obseved that for neutrons events that take place within the center of the films tend to deposit a large majority of their energy in the film, while events that occur on the edge of the film have partial energy depositions in accordance with the ranges of the charged particles.
A compton spectra is obseved in the photon energy deposition. 
A secondary effect in having a backing material is also observed for photons in which there is a hightened energy deposition for interactions that occur in the film but near the boundary and electrons are back scattered into the detector material.

The calculated gamma intrinsic efficiency for six polymeric films along with the neutron response of two of the films in Figure \ref{fig:GammaIntrNeutronCounts}, and the fraction of neutron counts above the MLLD necessary for a given gamma intrinsic efficiency is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:crVsIntEff}.
It is observed that if the films are thin enough (less than \SI{150}{\um}) it is possible to have a significant count rate above the mathematical lower level discriminator necessary for the pulse height discrimination of one in a million.
This is seen by the \SI{50}{\um} film and the \SI{150}{\um} film having the tail of their neutron spectra above the pulse height discriminator necessary for an intrinsic efficiency of \num{1E-6}.
Table \ref{tab:FractionCRGamma} shows the fraction of neutron count rate that is above the MLLD necessary for $\epsilon_{int,\gamma n} \le \si{1E-6}$.
Films less than \SI{50}{\um} have over 2\% of the counts above the necessary discriminator setting, while thicker films have have a factor of 10 less.

	\end{tabular}
  \label{tab:FractionCRGamma}
\end{table}
In addition it is observed in Figure \ref{fig:GammaIntrNeutronCounts} that for neutrons, thicker films only enhance the resolution of the film and do little to increase the light yield, as most of energy from a neutron event is captured in the film.
The average energy deposited was computed for each thickness and normalized by the incident energy for gammas by the Q-value of the reaction for neutrons, and is presented in Table ~\ref{tab:FractionEDep}.
For thickness greater than \SI{150}{\um} there is little benefit in increasing the thickness of the film in terms of energy deposition by neutrons, since over 90\% of the energy is being deposited in the film.

Figure \ref{fig:simKinE} illustrates the simulated kinetic energy of secondary electrons from Compton scattering and from alpha and triton interactions.
It is observed that kinetic energy of the secondary electrons from the neutron reaction products have predominately energies in the kilo-volt range, while the Compton scattering electrons have energies in hundreds of kilo-volts range. 
However, it should be noted that there is only one secondary electron from a Compton scattering and multiple secondary electrons from the reaction products.
Figure \ref{fig:ReacProdDist} shows the distribution of the number of secondary electrons from the alpha and triton and their kinetic energy.
