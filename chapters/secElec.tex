\chapter{Neutron - Gamma Discrimination}
\label{chap:SecElectron}



The pulse height discriminator setting necessary to achieve the neutron-gamma discrimination is achieved through the use of a mathematical lower level discriminator (MLLD).
This virtual discriminator establishes the bound where $\epsilon_{int,\gamma n}\leq 10^{-6}$, and counts above the MLLD are classified as neutron counts. 



The organization of this chapter is as follows.
An overview of scintillation mechanics of organic scintillators will be provided in \autoref{sec:ScintMechanics} in order to understand the relationship between scintillation and the energy deposited by charged particles.
The energy spectra and ranges of neutron and gamma reaction products will be discussed in \autoref{sec:InteractionsAndRange} (focusing on polystyrene) to explain the basis for the difference in energy depositions. 
Calculations of the energy deposition will be shown in \autoref{sec:EnergyDep} for polymeric materials, providing the foundation of neutron-gamma pulse height discrimination.
