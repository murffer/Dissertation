Alternative neutron detection technologies are required to replace the current \iso[3]{He} based Radiation Portal Monitors.
Replacement technologies must fulfill two basic criteria: 1) a neutron detection efficiency, and 2) the performance of the detector should not suffer in the the presence of a strong gamma field.
Polymeric films containing \iso[6]{LiF} ranging from \SI{15}{\um} to \SI{300}{\um} have the ability to fulfill these criteria if suitably utilized.
There exists a need to model and optimize these detector designs in order to ensure that the best performance is reached. 
For a typical detector this involves maximizing the neutron-gamma discrimination, maximizing the physical detector configuration in order to ensure optimal use of the incident neutron spectra, and ensuring that the scintillation light generated can be collected.
