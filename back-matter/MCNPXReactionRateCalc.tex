% MCNPX Model of the interaction rate
\chapter{MCNPX Tally Interactions}
The performance of films is simulated in MCNPX, a Monte Carlo transport code\cite{pelowitz_mcnpx_????}.

The interaction rate is calculated using the a cell flux tally in MCNPX and a tally multiplier card.
The tally multiplier card (FMn) is used to calculated any quantity of the form \eqref{eqn:FMCardForm} \cite{pelowitz_mcnpx_2006}
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:FMCardForm}
  I &= C\int\phi(E)\Re_m(E)dE
\end{align}
where \definevar{$I$}{Interaction rate}, \definevar{$\phi(E)$}{Energy dependent fluence} , \definevar{$\Re_m(E)$}{Response function operator} and $C$ is an arbitrary scalar for normalization.
An general example of the use of the FM card is shown in Listing \ref{lst:GeneralFMExample}, which is taken from the MCNPX manual \cite{pelowitz_mcnpx_????}.
% See pg. 4-41 of the MCNP manual
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={[Example usage of the FM card]Example usage of the FM card to calculate the number of reactions per \si{\cm\cubed} of type R in cell 8 of material M. The normalization is by atomic density, signified by the -1},label={lst:GeneralFMExample}]

FM104 -1 M R
\end{lstlisting}

The reaction rate $\iso[6]{Li}\left(\text{n},\text{t}\right)\alpha$ can be calculated by then applying the appropriate input for the FMn card and using an F4 card to calculate $\phi(E)$.
It should be noted that depending on the form of the cell flux card it may be necessary to normalize by the volume of the cell, $\forall$.
\nomenclature{$\forall$}{Volume of the cell}

This is shown in Listing \ref{lst:InteractionRateRPM}, where the reaction number is 105 and the material number of the detector is 3.
The interaction rate in a simulated RPM8 replacement detector is calculated in a similar manner as the simulation of the measured detectors; the interaction rate as computed by the \verb+FMn+ is multiplied by the source strength and volume if necessary.
An example of the MCNPX input cards is shown in Listing \ref{lst:InteractionRateRPM}.
Given that there the thermal response is not desired, there is no need to subtract out the differences between the spectra, and the interaction rate is simply \eqref{eqn:RPM8InteractionRate}.
Note that in this calculation the source strength is set to be \SI{1}{\nano\gram} \iso[252]{Cf}, which has a neutron emission rate of \SI{2.3E3}{neutron\per\second}.
This is in accordance with the direct evaluation of the PNNL criteria, which require a absolute neutron count rate of \SI{2.5}{count\per\second\per\nano\gram\iso[252]{Cf}}.

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:RPM8InteractionRate}
  I_{\text{sim}} &= S_0 I \\
  &= \SI{2.3E3}{neutron\per\second} I
\end{align}

$I_{\text{sim}}$ provides the total number of simulated neutron interactions in the detector.

The following tables provide examples of the positions of the layered geometry used for the genetic algorithm. 
These geometries correspond to \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering25} and \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering5}, and \autoref{fig:RPMLayeredRendering75}.
