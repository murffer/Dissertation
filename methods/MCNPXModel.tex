% MCNPX Model of the interaction rate
The performance of films is simulated in MCNPX, a Monte Carlo transport code\cite{pelowitz_mcnpx_2006}.
The geometry is as in the PNNL reports, namely a nano-gram of \iso[252]{Cf}  encased in \SI{0.5}{\cm} of lead and \SI{2.5}{\cm} of HDPE. 
The size of the RPM8 is \SI{12.7}{\cm} deep, by \SI{30}{\cm} wide and \SI{2}{\m} tall.
The interaction rate, $I_{\text{sim}}$ provides the total number of simulated neutron interactions in the detector and is calculated using the a cell flux tally in MCNPX and a tally multiplier card.
The reaction rate $\iso[6]{Li}\left(\text{n},\text{t}\right)\alpha$ can be calculated by then applying the appropriate input for the FMn card and using an F4 card to calculate $\phi(E)$.
This is in accordance with the direct evaluation of the PNNL criteria, which require a absolute neutron count rate of \SI{2.5}{count\per\second\per\nano\gram\iso[252]{Cf}}.
Note that in this calculation the source strength is set to be \SI{1}{\nano\gram} \iso[252]{Cf}, which has a neutron emission rate of \SI{2.3E3}{neutron\per\second}.
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:RPM8InteractionRate}
  I_{\text{sim}} &= S_0 I \\
  &= \SI{2.3E3}{neutron\per\second} I
\end{align}
However, not all of these interactions will lead to counts above the pulse height discriminator setting necessary for meeting the gamma intrinsic efficiency.
This is corrected for by scaling $I_{\text{sim}}$ by the fraction of counts, $\eta$, that occur above the gamma LLD \eqref{eqn:FractionOfCountsDefination}, \eqref{eqn:RPMCountRate}.
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:FractionOfCountsDefination}
  \eta \equiv \frac{\int_{MLLD}^\infty p(x)dx}{\int_0^\infty p(x)dx}
\end{align}
\nomenclature{$p(x)$}{Measured spectra, as a function of channel number}
\begin{align}
 \label{eqn:RPMCountRate}
 \text{Count Rate} &= I_{\text{sim}} \eta
\end{align}
 
The MCNPX model was benched marked for characterized samples in the in house \iso[252]{Cf} neutron irradiator by simulating the interaction rate and comparing it to the measured count rate.
These results are summarized in \autoref{tab:MCNPXVal}.
It should be noted that the interaction rate is not directly the count rate as an interaction needs to have its scintillation photons collected in order to be a count. 
One would then expect the simulated interaction rate to be a few precent higher than the measured count rate.
In addition the polymeric sample composition is determined before pressing or casting providing a means for the uncertainty of the composition.
