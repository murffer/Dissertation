A replacement portal monitor has been designed for layered polymeric films that effectively utilize the \iso[6]{Li} in the detector material. 
An example of the an optimized geometry is shown in \autoref{fig:SumDemoLiFZnS} in which the films are \SI{100}{\um} thick placed in a wavelength shifter.

The positions of the films necessary to meet the detector criteria are shown in \autoref{tab:SumPerf}.
These layered detector designs consist of \SI{100}{\um}, \iso[6]{Li} fluoride loaded polymers that are encased in \SI{5}{\mm} of a wavelength shifting plastic in addition to a \SI{100}{\um} \iso[6]{LiF} loaded ZnS:Ag commercial scintillator also encased in a wavelength shifter.
The wavelength shifter was assumed to have a material composition similar to that of high density polyethylene, which also served as the moderator.
If two \SI{2}{\in} photomultiplier tubes are placed at the top and bottom of a fishtail light guide mounted on the top and bottom of the detector cabinet, 8\% of the optical photons generated in a 10\% loaded polystyrene film can be collected.
It is assumed for the estimated \SI{5}{\in} PMT photons collected that the light collection efficiency of \SI{5}{\in} PMT can be estimated from the ratio of the \SI{2}{\in} PMT to \SI{5}{\in} PMT light collection efficiency as reported in \cite{pnnl_14283}.
