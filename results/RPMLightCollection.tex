Several previous authors have used the GEANT4 toolkit to simulate the light collection efficiency of their detector designs.
In PNNL 14283 the authors looked at a variety of different PMT placement and detectors designs to increase the light output of a detector in the Advanced Large-Area Plastic Scintillators (ALPS) project \cite{pnnl_14283}.
The authors found that for a \SI{127}{\cm} by \SI{57}{\cm} by \SI{5}{\cm} slab of BC-408 wrapped in a loose foil of 85\% reflectivity that the light output could be almost doubled by doubling the number of PMT's.
These results are summarized in \autoref{tab:PNNLLightCollectionEfficiency}.

In addition, other authors have reported on the simulation performance of a light guides and photon attenuation using the GEANT4 toolkit.

Differnet cladding coatings were studied for their effect on the collection efficiency of a scintillator.

The collection efficiencies are presented in \autoref{tab:CladStudy}.

%An overview of the light transport and scintillation processes available in GEANT4 is presented in \cite{riggi_introducing_2011}.
%The authors also simulated a \SI{1}{\m} by \SI{1}{\cm} by \SI{1}{\cm} plastic strip in order to calculate the photon attenuation in the plastic.
%Two orders of magnitude drop in the number of photons was calculated for photons collected \SI{90}{\cm} from the distance of emission, and was highly dependent of the reflectivity of the material encasing the plastic strip\cite{riggi_introducing_2011}.
%Polymeric detectors containing PPO/POPOP as the fluor have also been modeled for the light transport with GEANT4\cite{5485130}.
